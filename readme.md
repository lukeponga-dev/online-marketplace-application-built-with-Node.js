Tor (The Onion Router) is a network designed to enhance privacy and anonymity on the internet. It achieves this by routing internet traffic through multiple nodes, encrypting it at each step, and making it challenging to trace the source of the traffic. Let's break down the technical aspects of how Tor works.

Key Concepts of Tor

1. Onion Routing:

The name "Onion Routing" comes from the layers of encryption applied to data, much like the layers of an onion.

Data is encrypted in multiple layers, each layer being peeled off by a different Tor node (relay) as the data passes through, revealing the next destination.



2. Tor Network Architecture:

Tor Nodes (Relays): These are volunteer-run servers that help anonymize internet traffic.

Guard Nodes (Entry Nodes): The first point of contact in the Tor network.

Middle Relays: These relay data between the entry and exit nodes.

Exit Nodes: The last relay in the Tor chain before data reaches the internet.


Tor Circuits: A path through the Tor network consisting of a sequence of three nodes (Guard, Middle, Exit) is called a circuit. A new circuit is built every 10 minutes to maintain anonymity.




Step-by-Step Breakdown of How Tor Works

1. Tor Browser Setup:

The user starts by downloading and installing the Tor Browser, which is a modified version of Firefox with privacy enhancements.

Upon launch, the browser connects to the Tor network by communicating with Tor directory authorities to obtain a list of active Tor nodes.



2. Building a Circuit:

The Tor Browser selects three nodes to create a circuit:

Guard Node: The browser connects to this node first.

Middle Relay: The traffic is forwarded from the Guard Node to a Middle Relay.

Exit Node: Finally, data is sent to the Exit Node, which connects to the target website.


The Tor Browser encrypts data three times:

The outermost layer is encrypted with the Exit Node’s public key.

The middle layer is encrypted with the Middle Relay’s public key.

The innermost layer is encrypted with the Guard Node’s public key.




3. Data Transmission:

The encrypted data packet is sent to the Guard Node.

The Guard Node decrypts its layer and sends the packet to the Middle Relay.


The Middle Relay decrypts its layer and forwards the packet to the Exit Node.

The Exit Node decrypts the final layer and sends the original data to the destination website.

Responses from the website follow the reverse path (Exit → Middle → Guard → User).



4. Maintaining Anonymity:

Each node in the circuit only knows the IP address of the previous node and the next node.

The Guard Node knows the user's IP address but not the final destination.

The Exit Node knows the destination but not the user's IP address.

This design ensures that no single node knows both the source and the destination, thus preserving anonymity.




Example of Tor Circuit

Let's say a user wants to access example.com using the Tor network:

The user’s request is encrypted three times.

Guard Node receives the data, decrypts the first layer, and forwards it to the Middle Relay.

Middle Relay decrypts its layer and sends the data to the Exit Node.

Exit Node decrypts the final layer and connects to example.com.

The website sees the request coming from the Exit Node's IP, not the user's actual IP.


Technical Components of Tor

1. Tor Directory Authorities:

These are trusted servers that maintain a list of all active Tor nodes.

Tor clients use this list to build circuits.



2. Hidden Services:

Tor supports .onion services, which are websites that only exist within the Tor network.

These services do not use traditional DNS and are accessed via .onion addresses.

Hidden services ensure both the client and server are anonymous.



3. Encryption & Cryptography:

RSA Encryption: Used for exchanging session keys between nodes.

AES Encryption: Used for encrypting data between nodes.

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
